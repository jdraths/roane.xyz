# Meta


## Footnotes


They work as comments in notion, however, they cannot be inserted mid-paragraph via notion-to-md; they can only be inserted at the end of a paragraph. So like this footnote right here doesn‚Äôt show up until the end. [^2]


Footnotes also only work on h1s, paragraphs, todos, and bulletized lists. More notion blocks need to be added to `notion-to-md.ts` manually


## Word Count


You can get word count by clicking the kebab in the notion page and scrolling to the bottom. The blog then converts word count to read time.


## Syncing


For now, the blog is synced manually from notion. Simply grab the link from the Share button in Notion, then insert the link into `scripts/notion-to-md.ts` & run `pnpm sync`


> üí° > if you rename the title of the page and then subsequently resync the notion page, then the notion page will be resynced to a new page in the blog
